Real Variables
--------------
A: cursorX
B: cursorY
K: getKey
M: mode (2nd, upper alpha, lower alpha, none)
P: cursor position within string (P: token behind cursor, P+1: token in front of cursor)
V: vertical alignment line
Z: the top row displayed


Lists
-----
|LBNOTE
  Holds values for all notes, with -1 as a delimiter value between sublists.
  For Example:
    {1.000,14.089,-1.000} 
    The 1st element represents that only 1 note exists.
    The 2nd element reflects the text " Hello, World!" as 14 characters long and being 89 pixels in width.
    The 3rd element is the delimiter.
|LCNOTE
  Holds values for current note - integer part for max position/index of row, fractional part for total row width
  For Example:
    {14.089,22.056}
    The 1st element represents a row with 14 characters on it that is 89 pixels in width.
    The 2nd element is a continuation of the previous element, meaning the total characters in the note up to this row is 22. The row pixel width is 56.


Strings
-------
  Str2: Temporary storage for character entry or other miscellaneous necessities.
  Str6: All notes, with [ybar] as the delimiter token between notes.
  Str7: String that is being edited.
  Str8: Token dictionary, which is paralleled with Str9.
